
>>This Project is a Python Web Application running on Docker Compose.
>>This application uses the Flask Framework and maintains a hit counter in redis.
>> Requirements:
		Docker Engine
		Docker Compose
		Docker Images -> provide Redis / Python , flask.


>> Applicaton code for the project is @app.py.
>>DockerImage which contains all dependencies this python application requires @DockerFile.
>>Defining Services @docker-compose.yml.

>>Process of running Application:
	
	-> Start the docker-compose by using docker-compose up
			This will pulls a redis image , builds an image for code and starts the services we define.
	-> Enter host / local ip / webservices ip for access in a browser to see the aplication is running or not.
	-> Every time you refresh it will increase the count we refresh and show the text like "Hello World ! You have been seen 2 times."
->This is the basic objective of this appication but i edit the code @docker-compose.yml to add extra feature by adding following things :
		->volumes:
			- .:/code
		->environment:
			FLASK_ENV: development
->This will add BindMount Feature to the python application using this docker.
 		By this we can update the greeting along with the increment count @everytime we refresh.           :)
